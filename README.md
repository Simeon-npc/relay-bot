# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 05/17/2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the [Your Bot Name] Discord bot (“the Bot”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and discloses information when you use the Bot in a Discord server.

## 1. Information We Collect

We do **not** actively collect or store personal data from users. However, to function properly within Discord servers, the Bot may temporarily access the following data provided through Discord’s API:

- **Usernames and nicknames**
- **Message content** (for relaying messages, responding to commands, and moderation)
- **User and server IDs** (to store configuration settings or command usage context)
- **Media files or attachments** (temporarily, if your bot saves or processes media)

This data is only accessed when required for bot features and is never shared or sold.

## 2. How We Use Information

The Bot uses limited message and user data solely to:

- Execute commands initiated by users
- Respond to trigger phrases or bot prefixes
- Log or forward media (if enabled by server admins)
- Enforce cooldowns or user-specific limitations
- Display relayed or embedded content (e.g., event or broadcast messages)

All data is used in real-time and only retained temporarily as necessary for functionality.

## 3. Data Retention

- No user data is stored long-term.
- If the Bot downloads media files, they are saved locally for forwarding only and are not associated with identifiable personal info.
- Logs are not kept unless configured explicitly by server administrators.

## 4. Third-Party Sharing

We do **not** share your data with any third parties.

## 5. Your Rights

While we do not collect or store personal data, you may contact the bot developer at any time to:

- Request deletion of any stored data (if applicable)
- Ask for clarification about what the bot does

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Significant changes will be posted publicly.

## 7. Contact

If you have questions or concerns regarding this policy, you may contact the bot owner via Discord or through the following contact method:
